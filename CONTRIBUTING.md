# Contributing to vite-plugin-jsw

Thank you for wanting to contribute! This document covers the basics to make contributions smooth and reviewable.

## Get started
- Fork the repo and create a feature branch: `git checkout -b my-feature`.
- Keep changes focused and small; one logical change per PR.

## Code style
- Follow existing TypeScript style in the repository.
- Run formatters and linters if present before opening a PR.

## Tests
- Add tests for new features and bug fixes when applicable.
- Run any existing test commands locally before submitting a PR.

## Submitting changes (Pull Requests)
- Open a PR against the `master` branch with a clear description of the change and why it is needed.
- Link any related issues and include short reproduction steps if relevant.
- Be responsive to review feedback and update your branch as requested.

## Issues
- Open an issue with a minimal reproduction, expected behavior, and actual behavior.

## Commit messages
- Use clear, imperative commit messages (e.g., "Add feature X", "Fix bug Y").

## Notes and special rules
- Never write fallback code without asking the author or maintainer first — see `agents.md` for context.

If you're unsure about anything, open an issue or ping a maintainer—happy to help!

Thanks for improving `vite-plugin-jsw`.
